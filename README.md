# Traffic-Police-Data-Case-Study
Traffic Police Case Study â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on driver behavior, violations, and demographic patterns using Pandas, Matplotlib

# Overview

This project explores and analyzes real-world traffic stop data to uncover patterns in driver behavior, violations, and enforcement trends. Using Pythonâ€™s data analysis stack (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn), it identifies how factors such as driver gender, age, and race relate to traffic violations, arrests, and searches.

# Objectives

Understand trends in traffic stops by gender, race, and violation type

Visualize relationships between driver demographics and stop outcomes

Identify potential biases or disparities in traffic enforcement

Practice data cleaning, grouping, and visualization techniques

# Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas â€” data manipulation and pivot tables

NumPy â€” numerical computation

Matplotlib / Seaborn â€” data visualization

Jupyter Notebook â€” interactive analysis

# Dataset

The dataset includes fields such as:

stop_date, stop_time

driver_gender, driver_age, driver_race

violation, stop_outcome

search_conducted, is_arrested

(Data source: Stanford Open Policing Project
 or any similar dataset.)

# Key Insights

Distribution of stops by driver gender and violation type

Average age of drivers per violation

Percentage of stops resulting in search or arrest

Visualization of traffic stop trends using bar plots and pivot tables

# Example Code Snippets
# Distribution by gender
df['driver_gender'].value_counts().plot.bar()
plt.show()

# Average driver age per violation type
pd.pivot_table(df, index=['driver_gender', 'violation'], values='driver_age', aggfunc='mean')

# Future Improvements

Add time-series analysis of stop trends by year/month

Build a simple dashboard using Plotly or Streamlit

Perform correlation and bias detection
